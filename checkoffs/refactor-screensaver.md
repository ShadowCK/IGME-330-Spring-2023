# Checkoff - Refactor the Canvas Screensaver

## I. Start code
- Your starting point will be the completed vrsion. of [PE-04 - Canvas Screensaver](../pe/04/pe-04.md)

<hr>

## II. Refactor the code!

- Create a folder named ***lastName-firstInitial*-screensaver-refactored**
- Make a copy of ***lastName-firstInitial*-cs-canvas-5.html**
  - name this copy ***lastName-firstInitial*-screensaver-done.html**
  - put the copy in the above folder you just created

1) Make sure that your HTML and JS is following our [IGME-330 class code standards](../notes/code-style-required-330.md)

    - examples:
      - `<button id="btnPlay">Play</button>` needs to be `<button id="btn-play">Play</button>`
      - `<button id="btnPause">Pause</button>` needs to be `<button id="btn-pause">Pause</button>`
      - `<input type="checkbox" id="cbRectangles">`mneeds to be `<input type="checkbox" id="cb-rectangles">`
      - etc
    - Be sure to refactor your CSS & JS to match the new `id` values
    - ***Test the app thoroughly to be sure it still works! Fix things as necessary. And then move on.***

2) Convert all of the functions in the app to [arrow functions](../notes/js-functions.md#vi-b-arrow-function-examples)

    - ***Test the app thoroughly to be sure it still works! Fix things and move code as necessary. And then move on.***

3) Replace all instances of string concatenation with [template strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
   
   - for example - in the `getRandomColor()` function
    - ***Test the app thoroughly to be sure it still works! Fix things as necessary. And then move on.***

4) Convert the app over to ES6 module syntax
