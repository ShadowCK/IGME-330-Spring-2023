## I. Start code
- Your starting point can be:
  - the completed version of your Phyllotaxis app from [PE-05 - Algorthmic Botany](../pe/pe-05.md)
  - OR the start file below (a demo version of Phyllotaxis from class)
  - Other resources:
    - [ES6 Object Notes](../notes/object-notes.md)
    - [ES6 Class Notes](../notes/es6-class-notes.md) - the start file here might be handy too

- Convert the Phyllotaxis code to utilze an ES6 class named `PhylloFlower`, which has:
  - `update()` and `draw()` methods
  - `x`, `y`, `n`, `divergence` and `c` properties

## IV. Submission

- You are free to put the `PhylloFlower` class in the HTML file, or in a separate JS file
  - if you have multiple files, name your root folder ***lastName-firstInitial*-phylloclassy**
  - if you have everything in just 1 HTML file, name your root folder ***lastName-firstInitial*-phylloclassy.html**
- ZIP and post the folder (or file) to myCourses
