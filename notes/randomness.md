# Randomness and Aesthetics

## Overview 

**One of the themes of this course will be looking at what role *randomness* can play in the creation of interactive experiences.**

- "Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness
- Randomness is sometimes used as a generative principle in art, both traditional and digital.

## I. The Dada movement

The Dada art movement from the early 20th century was an "anti-art" movement that challenged conventional notions of aesthetics and cultural norms. It came into being in reaction to the horrors of World War I, and the bourgeois culture that was blamed on bringing the war about.  Pure reason and logic were seen as having failed the world. 

Dadaist works often seem designed to offend and reject logic, while embracing chaos and irrationality. The techniques they used include:

- Collage
- Cut-up technique
- Photomontage
- Assemblage
- Readymades

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada#Art_techniques_developed

## II. Dada - Chance & Randomness

The Dadaist *Collage* and *Cut-up* techniques frequently involved the use of randomness in the creation of artistic works. **Watch this video -->**  *Dada - Chance & Randomness* (4:05) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k40U4UPiiPs

The narration at the beginning of this video is hard to understand - here it is:

*"The official belief in the infallibility of reason, logic and causality seemed to us senseless - as senseless as the destruction of the world and the systematic elimination of every particle of human feeling. This was the reason why were were forced to look for something that would re-establish our humanity. What we needed to find was a balance between heaven and hell. A new unity combining chance and design."* - Hans Richter


## III. Jean Arp

Jean Arp (work seen in video above) was a Dadaist German-French sculptor, painter, poet, and abstract artist in other media such as torn and pasted paper. 

Works:
- **Check out** *Untitled* (Collage with Squares Arranged according to the Laws of Chance)
1916â€“17 --> https://www.moma.org/collection/works/37013?artist_id=11&locale=en&page=1&sov_referrer=artist
- **Also see** *According to the Laws of Chance* --> https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/arp-according-to-the-laws-of-chance-t05005
- **And** --> https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/jean-arp

It was pointed out in the video above that his collage of squares did not appear to be fully random, but instead was curated by modifying where the pieces of paper dropped, or was created many times until an interesting arrangment of squares presented itself. 

## IV. Tristan Tzara

Tristan Tzara (work seen in video above) was a Romanian and French avant-garde poet, essayist and performance artist. He is best known for being one of the founders and central figures of the Dada movement. He was the pioneer of the "cut up" method of creating procedural text.

How "To make a Dadaist Poem" (1920):

- Take a newspaper.
- Take some scissors.
- Choose from this paper an article the length you want to make your poem.
- Cut out the article.
- Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them all in a bag.
- Shake gently.
- Next take out each cutting one after the other.
- Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
- The poem will resemble you.
- And there you are - an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.

You may have heard of the author William Burroughs and his *Naked Lunch* novel, which also utilized this cut-up method.

## V. Automatism

*Automatism* refers to creating art without conscious thought, accessing material from the unconscious mind as part of the creative process - https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/automatism

- **Check out *Danger of Death* by Jean Arp - which uses "earthquake lines" to produce an apparently random drawing -->** https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/arp-danger-of-death-t05007
- As with his collage of squares above, there are indications of premeditation (fainter pencil marks and partial erasures) that suggest that the work is not fully random.

## VI. Moving to the digital medium

- We can easily utilize many of these techniques digitally. Georg Nees was a German academic who was a pioneer of computer art and generative graphics. His *Schotter* piece from the 1960's used randomness to change the position and rotation of squares, more chaotically in the later rows of the work. 

- **Check it out here -->** http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/schotter/

- **And more of his work can be seen here -->** http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/agent/15

- ***But how much randomness whould we use? What sorts of constrainsts should be applied?***
 
*"The random generators add subject matter to the aesthetic structure or form. If the random generators were to rule alone, chaos would emerge. Because the aesthetic structure narrows down randomness by means of a computer programme, it "in-forms" the chaos. Discernible aesthetic information is thus produced."* -  Georg Nees (1969)

- **A great blog on randomness and digital art is here -->** https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2014/what-programming-brings-to-art

In this post, he lists 5 differentiators that programming brings to art:
  - Precision
  - Randomness
  - Mutability and Iterative Experimentation
  - Reuse
  - Scale
  

## VII. Randomness in this course
*(No, I don't mean the grading and lectures!)*

We will give you several opportunities to explore the use of randomness in digital media:

- Here is a demo using a library named SimplexNoise - which is procedural nosie similar to Perline Noise - [simplex-noise-1.md](./simplex-noise-1.md)
- The "screensaver" exercise in [canvas-1.md](./canvas-1.md) (inspired by Arp's *Collage with Squares Arranged according to the Laws of Chance*)
- The [HW-random-walker.md](./HW-random-walker.md) exercise (inspired by Arp's *Danger of Death*)
- The [HW-hello-canvas.md](./HW-hello-canvas.md) exercise
- NLP ("Natural Language Processing") and computational text exercises that we will do later in the semester. These are inspired by Tristan Tzara's "cut-up" method of creating random text.  We will use JavaScript libraries such as *RiTa* (pronounced "Rita") --> https://rednoise.org/rita/ and *NLP Compromise* --> http://compromise.cool to accomplish this.
