## I. App Data Files
### I-A. Structure
- Parallel arrays **:-(**
- Something like this was seen fairly often (note also the `title` is in an array - ***why?***)

```json

```

- A better solution groups related data under object literals, and uses a string instead of an array (so don't get "array-itus"?)

```json

```
