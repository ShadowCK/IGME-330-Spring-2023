# To Do

- Some course changes, below

## I. Syllabus

- Attendance: emphasize that absences are only fully excused with documentation from the college
  - Automatic early alert to be sent when a student misses 2 classes?
- Stuff students must do:
  - Slack: Introduction posted to Slack (so that we know they are properly enrolled in the channel)
    - 100% of course communication will be through Slack?
  - Must sign up for account with https://editor.p5js.org/ (GitHUb accounts can be connected I believe)
    - this is for some of the "Daily Checkoffs"
    - is there another REPL we could use instead?

<hr>


## II. Daily Activity/Checkoffs
- I got rid of all the in-class exercises/activities when we went online during the pandemic. It's time to bring them back, but with better participation from the students
- Most days will have an "attendance quiz/activity" that starts right at the beginning of class
  - there will be an associated myCourses dropbox - "Daily Checkoffs" or something like that
  - we will generally grade these just for completion, not correctness
  - some code challenges will be like these: 
    - https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas
    - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/
    - https://leetcode.com/explore/
  - many of these will be due 15 or 20 minutes after the start of class, because we will be going over them the same day in-class
    - no late submissions allowed
 
<hr>

## III. Practice Exercises
- about 20 of these
 
<hr>

## IV. HW assignments
- about 6 of these ...
- **Technobabble** 
  - The ultimate version with ES6 modules, Ajax, JSON, mobile friendly
- **Drawing App**
  - basic canvas
  - a little Bulma?
  - App defaults stored in JSON file
- **Audio Visualizer**
  - add in canvas `imageData`
  - WebAudio
- **Rhymer**
  - RiTa.js, A word API?, Web Components?
  - Multi-page (2) and more Bulma, Nav System & component
- **Web App I.**
  - Mapbox?
  - There is a short list of location-based web services they can choose from
  - localStorage, favorites state persistance
    - Bulma and Web Components still required
- **Web App II.**
  - Firebase
  - App page state persistance (UI and Search reults)

<hr>

## V. Exams
- Written, there will be 2 or 3
- Final exam is on last day of class

<hr>

## VI. Grading?

- Checkoffs - 10%
- Practice Exercises - 20%
- HW Assignments - 30%
- Exams (2 or 3) - 40%

<hr>

## VII. Attendance policy?
- Does a too generous attendance policy - "write us in advance and we'll excuse you" - hurt the weaker students (who are more likely to skip)?
- Attendance - deduction for 2 or more absences
- We would like you to let us know in advance if you are not going to make it to class, but absences are only excused with written documentation from the college

<hr>

## VIII. Late Assignment Policy?
- The pandemic is over - "No excuses" extensions should be too
- All assignments get a 3-hour extension (the "3AM" thing)
- There will be a general late dropbox:
  - 3 to 6 hours late, -10%
  - 6 to 24 hours late, -20%
  - 24 - 48 hours late, -40%
  - nothing will be accepted more than 48 hours late without prior arrangement
- *Documented* college activities, RIT career day, etc are valid excuses
