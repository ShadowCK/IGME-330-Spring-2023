# To Do

- Some course changes, below

## I. Syllabus

- Attendance: emphasize that absences are only fully excused with documentation from the college
  - Automatic early alert to be sent when a student misses 2 classes?
- Stuff student must do:
  - Slack: Introduction posted to Slack (so that we know they are properly enrolld in the channel)
    - 100% of course communication will be through Slack?
  - Must sign up for account with https://editor.p5js.org/ (GitHUb accounts can be connected I believe)
    - this is for some of the "Daily Checkoffs"
    - is there another REPL we could use instead?

<hr>


## II. Daily Activity

- Most days will have an "attendance quiz/activity" that starts right at the beginning of class
  - there will be an associated myCourses dropbox - "Daily Checkoffs" or something like that
  - we will generally grade these just for completion, not correctness
  - some code challenges will be like these: 
    - https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas
    - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/
    - https://leetcode.com/explore/

## III. Practice Exercises
