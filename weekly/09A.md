# III. Node.js

- **Node.js** is a command-line JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world

- Node.js runs on your local machine via the command line, or on a server, it does not run in the user's browser
