 ## II. *To Preload, or to not Preload*, that is the question
 
 - See **image-preloader-demos.zip** in myCourses
 - **canvas-image-preloader.html**
   - added an array to hold the image and modified the code so that it would be more compatiable with HW-2
 - **canvas-image-NO-preloader.html**
   - same code, but NO image pre-loader function, but the animation works fine, why?
