## I. What is canvas?
- Canvas is a 2D bitmap drawing API that allows the developer to write code that draws shapes and images into a browser window without the need for a plug-in like Flash or Java.

- Let's look at these links to see a small sample of what we can do with canvas - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/1-canvas-intro-to-drawing-context.md#what-is-it-good-for

  - Concepts:
    - What is canvas?
    - Alternative drawing APIs
    - Obtaining a *drawing context* and performing simple drawing (rectangles)
  - Docs:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element
    - Get a *drawing context*
      - [`canvas.getContext("2d")`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext)
    - Canvas *convenience* methods:
      - [`ctx.fillRect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillRect)
      - [`ctx.strokeRect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/strokeRect)
    - Canvas *drawing state* properties:
      - [`ctx.fillStyle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillStyle)
      - [`ctx.strokeStyle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/strokeStyle)

- 2 - [Canvas 2D Essential Skills #2 - Paths & Lines & Arcs](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/2-canvas-paths-lines-arcs.md):
  - Concepts:
    - Creating rectangle, line and circle (arc) *paths*
    - Filling and stroking the *current path*
  - Get started with paths:
    - [`ctx.beginPath()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/beginPath)
    - [`ctx.closePath()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/closePath)
    - [`ctx.rect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/rect)
    - [`ctx.fill()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fill)
    - [`ctx.stroke()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/stroke)
  - Line methods:
    - [`ctx.moveTo()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/moveTo)
    - [`ctx.lineTo()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineTo)
  - Arc methods:
    - [`ctx.arc()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/arc)

## IV. Togetherness Activity for 9B - Canvas Study Guide #1

- See myCourses for the starter code file - **sg-1-files.zip**
- We will hand out a paper copy of SG-1 (we are not collecting this, but it will likely help on the next exam)
- There IS an extra-credit checkoff dropbox for the last part - **IV. Make Something**
- Handy links:
  - The canvas API is focused on drawing, and is fairly lightweight. The full specification is here: http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/
  - Our free canvas "textbook" is located here: https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTML-canvas-guide/Introduction/Introduction.html
  - Another great online reference is here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial
- Now we'll walk through this SG together - and let you get started on the extra credit
