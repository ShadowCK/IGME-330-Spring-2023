## III. Review 6B Take-home quiz
  - PDF is in myCourses
  - Concepts:
    - *reference* types v. *value* types
    - adding properties (or misspelling existing properties) to existing objects (both literals and "class made")
    - calling non-existent methods on objects
    - what `Object.seal()` does to objects & arrays
    - what `Object.freeze()` does to objects & arrays
    - how about if a property (or array element) *points* at a reference type?
  - Resources that will help:
    - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2023/blob/main/notes/object-notes.md
    - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2023/blob/main/notes/es6-class-notes.md
    - Immutability with `const`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const
    - JS value v. Reference types: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-primitive-vs-reference-values/
    - Every value in JS can be *treated* like an object:
      - Note that we DID NOT say that ~"Every value in JavaScript IS an object"~ <-- this statement is NOT true

## IV. Canvas Transformations

- [**Canvas 2D Essential Skills #8 - Canvas Transformations**](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/8-canvas-transformations.md)
  - Concepts:
    - Transformations: `ctx.translate()`, `ctx.rotate()`, `ctx.scale()`
    - Managing transformations with `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()`
  - Docs:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Transformations
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/translate
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/rotate
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/scale
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/setTransform

## V. Checkoff - Translate/Rotate/Scale

- ***Here are the instructions (see myCourses dropbox for due date):***

1) Follow along with the demo we do in class on 7B - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/8-canvas-transformations.md - and build what we built.

2) If you miss anything - no problem! The video links at the bottom of the page walk though the entire demo.

3) Once you have re-created what we made (if it's slightly different than ours, no biggie!), add the following:

    - draw an additional rotating triangle
    - draw that triangle with a triangle helper function - no we didn't make this function in the demo - you can do it - be sure to use the "good triangle" code that draws around 0,0
    - draw at least one more animated shape (square, triangle,circle, ...). For this, you must animate either scale or translation (or both, or add in rotation and do all 3!)

4) Tell us what you did in the comments field of the dropbox

5) Name the file ***lastName-firstInitial*-trs.html**

6) ZIP and POST the file here
