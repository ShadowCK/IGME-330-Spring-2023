# Week 7B

## Review 6B Quiz
  - PDF is in myCourses
  - Concepts:
    - *reference* types v. *value* types
    - adding properties (or misspelling existing properties) to existing objects (both literals and "class made")
    - calling non-existent methods on objects
    - what `Object.seal()` does to objects & arrays
    - what `Object.freeze()` does to objects & arrays
    - how about if a property (or array element) *points* at a reference type?

    - Immutability with `const`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const
    - JS value v. Reference types: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-primitive-vs-reference-values/
    - Every value in JS can be *treated* like an object:
      - Note that we DID NOT say that ~"Every value in JavaScript IS an object"~ <-- this statement is NOT true
