# Week 1A

## I. Course Description & Topics

**Official description from SIS**
*This course provides students the opportunity to explore the design and development of media-rich web applications that utilize both static and procedurally manipulated media such as text, images and audio. This course examines client and server-side web development and features common to such applications. Issues explored include framework characteristics, information management, presentation, interactivity, persistence, and data binding. Programming projects are required.*

## II. Course Topics
- Foundational JavaScript Review
  - *~~`var`~~*
  - `let`, `const` & variable scope/lifetime
  - Primitive (value) Types: String, Number
  - Reference types: Objects (including arrays, DOM elements, other built in objects)
  - Iteration: `for`, `for...of`, `for...in`, `array.forEach()`
  - Comparison operators: `==` v. `===` & `!==`, `<`, `<=` etc ...
  - Functions - parameters & return values, default arguments
  - More functions - anonymous functions, arrow functions
- CSS Review
  - CSS selectors - type, class, id, attribute, sibling, child
  - Bulma CSS framework
- DOM Traversal & Manipulation
  - *~~`document.getElementById()`, `document.getElementsByTagName()`, `document.getElementsByTagNameNS()`, `document.getElementsByClassName()`, `document.getElementsByName()`~~*
  - `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`
  - `document.createElement()`, `appendChild()`, `getAttribute()`, `setAttribute()`
  - `.innerHTML`
  - HTML rendering with higher-order functions: `array.map()` and `array.join()`
- Modern "Vanilla" JavaScript
  - ES6 modules - `import` & `export`
  - Object & array destructuring, spread/rest operators, optionals and nullish-coalescing operator
  - Web Components - shadow DOM, lifecycle, passing data in, data binding
  - Event bubbling and dispatching custom events
  - Mysteries of the 'this` keyword - `this` in timers, `function.bind()` and arrow functions to the rescue
  - Closures
  - Objects - literals, classes, prototype chain
  - `Object.freeze()`, `Object.seal()`, `Object.assign()` etc
- Code style & quality
  - [JavaScript Code Style](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Shared/blob/main/notes/code-style-intro.md)

  - Debugging your code
- Ajax & Asynchronous code
  - `XHR` (review from 235) - *callback* pattern and `try`/`catch`
  - `fetch()` and - *promise* pattern
  - `Promise` API - `.then()`/`.catch()` and `async`/`await` 
- Data
  - Plain Text/CSV/XML
  - JSON
  - `.localStorage` and a **storage.js** module
  - Firebase cloud storage with Realtime Database
- Modern Web Dev Tools
  - Basic Node.js
  - npm ("Node Package Manager") ecosystem
  - Bundling code
  - TypeScript & *transpiling*
- Canvas
  - Drawing API
  - Drawing state properties & stack
  - Manipulating `imageData` for Photoshop like effects
  - Capturing WebCam input
  - "Creative coding" - some procedural generation (Flowers, Lorenz Attractors etc)
- PHP 
  - Basics of PHP & getting it working on banjo
  - API Proxy Server/Wrapper
  - Discussion of HTTP protocol - request/response headers, content types etc
- 3rd Party Web Frameworks
  - React & Vue - demo of component model and built-in data binding capabilities

## III. 330's Technology "Stack"

- Web technology "stacks" consist of
  - a "front end" client application that the user interacts with - in this course we will create HTML/CSS/JS front ends
  - a "back end" application that contains a database & the business logic of the application - in this course we'll be using a little PHP, as well as the Firebase  Realtime database to store data in the cloud
  - "full stack" refers to the entire application from the "front end" to the back end, as well as the code that connects the two parts
- The number and variety of development stacks being used right now is truly mind-numbing, and the list continually grows. Existing APIs are continually updated and old ones deprecated. Event the dominant frameworks like Angular and React are continually updated.  - Here are some current options being used in industry:
  - Front ends:
    - could be built out of HTML/CSS/JS, or native iOS, native Android, Flutter or Java
    - Popular front-end frameworks and tools - React, Angular, Vue, Flutter, TypeScript, 
  - Back ends:
    - **LAMP** - Linux/Apache/mySQL/PHP (and oldie, but still used)  - also WAMP, WIMP, MAMP, SAMP, FAMP, iAMP, LEMP, LYME, LYCE and so on 
    - **MEAN** - MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node and **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) and **MEVN** (Vue.js instead of React)
  - Cloud Providers - 
  - Meta Frameworks
  - Hopefully you get the idea - there are a gigantic number of technologies and combinations:

    - https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/01/10-web-development-frameworks-fullstack-developer-should-learn.html=
- Our "330 stack" is built on foundational web technologies and is relatively "stable":
  - HTML/CSS
  - Vanilla JS (i.e. no 3rd party frameworks such as React)
  - Web Components
  - A little PHP
  - Firebase (Realtime Database)
  - Some TypeScript
