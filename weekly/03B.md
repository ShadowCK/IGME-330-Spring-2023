## III. Catch up & questions
  - ES6 Modules
  - `XHR` and text,csv,xml
    - [PE-03 - Review `XHR` & Parsing Text/CSV/XML](../pe/pe-03.md)
    - Let's review together
  - `XHR` and JSON
    - [Ajax-4 - loading and parsing JSON files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md)
    - Demo:
      - We will be using the [`xhr.responseText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/responseText) property again
      - We will also use the [`JSON.parse()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) method will parse a JSON string and turn it into a JavaScript value for us
      - We will also "break" the JSON and see how our code responds
      - We will also give `XHR` a "bad" URL to see what happens (hint: we'll get back a "404" page - which is an HTML file)
      - [`try/catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) will come in handy here!
      - We will write "guard" code that displays a message if the JSON is "bad" (e.g. not *well-formed*) or not *valid* (it's missing a key we were expecting to be there)
      - Here is a nice tool for making sure that your JSON is *well-formed* - https://jsonlint.com
