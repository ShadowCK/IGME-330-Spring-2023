## V. Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and may be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early, or doing HW for a different course).

<hr>

## VI. Grading

### VI-A. Exams (40%)
- 3 written exams covering concepts, as well as "write some code" questions

### VI-B. Homework Assignments (30%)
- Substantial assignments that you will given a week to complete, 5 or 6 of these will be assigned during the semester

### VI-C. Practice Exercises (20%)
- there will be approximately 20 of these take-home exercises assigned during the semester

### VI-D. In-class/take-home Checkoffs (10%)
- These will often be small in-class demos or challenges that you will need to post prior to leaving class for the day
- Others will be short out-of-class assignments such as "Watch this XHR/JSON video walkthough and get the code working"

### VI-E. Attendance/Participation
- Missing class results in a deduction from your final course average: 
  - zero or 1 absence = +1% to final average
  - 2 absences = -1% to final average
  - 3 absences = -4%
  - 4 absences = -6%
  - 5+ absences = F in course
  - Being late counts as 1/2 of an absence
  - You can request to be excused from a class meeting for a school or career related opportunity  - write your instructor *in advance* of that class meeting. 
  - If you can't attend class for any reason, always let us know *in advance*. But be advised that if you are not given advance permission by your instructor to miss a class meeting, an absence will not be excused unless there is documentation of the reasons for that absence by RIT

<!--
### Homework (15%)
Completing the HW and in-class exercises is essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of one HW assignment (or "Check off", see below) per class meeting. Keep an eye on the mycourses dropboxes for the dues dates of these assignments. **Important!** - When you submit web file(s) (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) to mycourses dropboxes, they (or the folder they are contained in) must be zipped. If you do not do so, mycourses will strip out all of the CSS and JavaScript, and leave you with a non-functioning and ugly web page. Unzipped assignments will therefore usually receive a grade of zero.

### Check Offs (10%)
"Check offs" are required checkpoints or smaller HW assignments

-->



### VI-F. Grade Scale

Final course grades are determined using the following scale: 

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |

<hr>

## VII. More grading policies

### VII-A. Late assignments
- Assignments will not be accepted late without the prior approval of the instructor

### VII-B. Grading requirements to pass the course
- To pass this course, you must meet **BOTH** of the following requirements:
  - your overall course grade must be greater than or equal to 65%
  - the weighted average of your 3 exams must be greater than or equal to 65%

### VII-C. Policy on Incomplete Grades
- Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, soley for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty. 

###  VII-D. Academic Dishonesty
- The course policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing or commiting duplicate submission without permission, you get an "F" as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.) Please review RIT's policy on academic dishonesty: 
[http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html](http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html)
- **Duplicate submission** is the submitting of the same or similar work for credit in more than one course without prior approval of the instructors for those same courses. *If you took IGME-330 previously, you **may not** hand in code that you previously submitted (for example, a previous version of an Audio Visualizer, or game, or web app)*

<hr>

## VIII. Important RIT Deadlines
- Note the deadlines for Add/Drop & "W" here: https://www.rit.edu/calendar
- You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade. 

<hr>

## IX. Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.
