## I. Technobabble Part I.

- Here is the link to Part I.
  - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-technobabble.md
  - Note that the video is using an iPhone Simulator to preview the mobile version of the site. You can instead use Chrome's "Device Mode", which is under the developer tools, which you can *right-click and choose "Inspect"* to open. We should have also demoed this in-class, but in case we didn't, or if you forgot how to do it, check out these links below:
  - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/
